<h1 style="font-size: 20px">CHORUS - <i>Surfboard Retail Company Website</i> - 2022</h1>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>

The following project is a website design concept presentation, based from an auto-generated design brief, for a fictional retail company called Hourglass. They make affordable minivans with an emphasis on design and their target audience is older teens/young adults.

<!--The following project is a website design concept presentation, based from an auto-generated design brief, for a fictional retail company called Chorus. They make customized luxury surfboards and their target audience is kids. (Prototype dimensions in Adobe XD: 1920 x 1080 px.)-->

<h2 style="font-size: 18px">THE CHALLENGE</h2>

The inquiry from Hourglass was for a design that conveys an influential brand and feels consistent throughout the prototype. They wanted an informative website that is easy to navigate. The inquiry requested it include About, Shop, and Privacy Policy Pages, with the Landing Page containing a Contact Us section. They wanted a section of the landing page dedicated to convincing users to subscribe to their newsletter. They also wanted a luxurious design that incorporates their brand color, yellow.

<!--The inquiry from Chorus was for a design that conveys a sense of victory, while at the same time being kind. They wanted a website that sells the company's products. The inquiry requested a Landing Page with the goal of maximizing conversions, an About Page, Shop Page, and a Privacy Policy page. They requested the Call to Action to be convincing users to call the company for more information. They also preferred a minimal design that incorporates their brand color, which is blue.-->

<h2 style="font-size: 18px">THE PROCESS</h2>

<!--The above is my completed (version 1) clickable, high-fidelity wireframe prototype personally created in Adobe XD based on the fictional client's request, design structures used in real surfboard retailers' websites, and user experience (UX) design standards and guidelines. *Prototype contains "Lorem Ipsums" taking the place of an actual body of content a real client would have written. Images were taken from resources such as Unsplash, Pexels, Shutterstock, etc.-->

<!--Once I made my v. 1 prototype, I uploaded it to a website creators use for finding real volunteers to test their interface designs to gain insights on moving forward with re-designing an improved, finalized project. I commissioned a minimum of 20 testers, male and female, between the ages of 18 to 65, to test the mission of moving from the starting point at the Landing Page, to the ending point at the Order Surfboard Page. Below are the quantitative test results.-->

<!--Below are the polled opinions testers selected regarding the difficulty level of the mission and the visual design/layout of the interface after the user completes the whole mission and views the other pages unrelated to the mission, such as the About Us and Privacy Policy pages. *Due to the technical limitations of the testing website, users were not able to view elements that involved animations/movement.-->

<!--I found from these results that almost all of the testers left with a positive impression. When asked on the prototype's strengths, testers mostly commented on its ease of use, cleanness of design, usage of images, and logical flow of information. Testers did not offer much in the way of commenting on the prototype's weaknesses, but what I've gathered from those responses, the prototype could stand to be more dynamic and modernized aesthetically. 
Commonly written suggestions given by testers when asked to view the prototype page by page included:
*Incorporating more color variety
*Implementing main background color that isn't white
*Moving placement of, and re-sizing, certain buttons & boxes
*Improving alignment and increasing spacing between headers
*Making Logo and Call to Action on Landing Page more prominent
*Cutting down on amount of text, particularly on Employee Profile Page-->

<!--Reflecting on the input received from my testers, and returning to version 1 after several weeks since its completion with a renewed perspective, I created this finalized version.-->

<!--Re-visiting this project encouraged me to think outside the box in finding ways to incorporate more color and remove monotony throughout the design. Upon re-navigating through the user flow of my version 1 and then doing the same with this version, I realize how much more visually pleasing the prototype is, now that backgrounds and elements are more varied in color, major sections of text have been re-worked for improved readability, and elements now have more appropriate levels of white space separating them.
I enjoyed creating a newer page layout for the supplementary pages, such as the Privacy Policy, that I find looks much more dynamic and visually interesting now. In my goal to re-think my use of color throughout the prototype, I discovered a neat opportunity in re-working the design of the top screen surfboard logo on the primary pages and have this element now function as the top toolbar, bringing the imagery and page names together. These two significant changes, among others, proved to help in establishing a much fresher, modernized prototype.-->

Starting out, I reflected on what the client wanted to establish the above brand guidelines to work off of, observing design structures used in real vehicle retailers' websites, and taking into account user experience (UX) design standards. Next came the process of creating the clickable, high-fidelity wireframe prototype (version 1) in Adobe XD. The prototype contains "Lorem Ipsums" taking the place of an actual body of content a real client would have written. Images were sourced from resources such as Unsplash, Pexels, Shutterstock, etc.

Once I made my v. 1 prototype, I uploaded it to a website creators use for finding real volunteers to test their interface designs to gain insights on moving forward with re-designing an improved, finalized project. I commissioned a minimum of 20 testers, male and female, between the ages of 18 to 65, to test the mission of moving from the starting point at the Landing Page, to the ending point at the Schedule Test Drive Page. Testers provided feedback regarding the difficulty level of the mission to schedule a test drive, and gave their opinions on the visual design/layout of the interface's mission critical pages, as well as supplemental pages like the About Us and Locate Dealer pages. Due to the technical limitations of the testing website, users were not able to view non-static elements such as animations/transitions.

From these results, I found that almost all of the testers had a positive impression. When asked on the prototype's strengths, testers mostly commented on its ease of use, intuitiveness, cleanness of design, and logical flow of information. Testers did not offer much in the way of commenting on the prototype's weaknesses, but what I've gathered from those responses, the prototype could stand to be more dynamic and modernized aesthetically.

Commonly written suggestions given by testers included:

<ul>
  <li>Incorporating more color variety</li>
  <li>Decreasing number of vehicle description boxes on each Shop Page</li>
  <li>Reducing amounts of text to de-clutter Shop, About Us, & Privacy Policy Pages</li>
  <li>Improving the map design on Locate Dealer Page</li>
  <li>Changing "Shop" to "Find a Vehicle", as that phrase better fits user flow's end destination</li>
  <li>Improving design of Landing Page's hero box so it's more eye-catching</li>
</ul>

Keeping this feedback in mind, I re-visited my prototype to create an updated version with a renewed perspective.
